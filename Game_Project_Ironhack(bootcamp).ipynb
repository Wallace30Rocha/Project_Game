We also need to figure out how to unlock it's superpowers because that's the only to restore the demage created for it's abstence from where it belongs.\\nIt’s a risky mission!\\nThere is also another issue - the king of the Golden Crickets Clan is missing (we believe he is now a hostage). He is one of the most inteligent creatures and probably the only one who could solve the monument's mystery.We hope he left some clues along the way\\nOur quest is extremely important and has the following goals:\\n\\n- Discover who stole it;\\n- How did they do it;\\n- Where the monument is now located:\\n- Defeat the thieves and bring the monument back;\\n- Unlock the mysteries it's mysteries;\\n\\nThe suspect Clans are:\"\n",

They use their white wings to reflect the sun only to the places where they live, leaving the rest of the forest in the dark.\\nThey believe that all creatures that cannot fly are only good for a big old supper. Their goal is to complete dominate the skies.\\nTip: buterflies can't stand a good old fart!\\n\\n(3) But Juice Slugs\\nThink about disgusting dudes.Everywhere they go they live a trail that becomes uninhabitable for other creatures. Their colonies are off the limits in the ancient rivers and they have been planing a massive revolt for centures.\\nBut they are slow and don't have the fighting skills necessary to win a revolution.\\nIt is believed that the superpower of the monument allows to control and manipulate time.\\nTip: when the ground shakes they roll over and takes daaaays to stand up again!\\n\\n(4) Stinky Spinders\\nOne of the most scary looking things in the entire realm. Cleaver, fast and deceiving. Their biggest fight is with the frogs. Their goal is solelly to eliminate them. According to legends, the monument could be use to manipulate the minds.\\nMaybe their plan is make grogs their slaves.\\nTip: their biggest fear are the waves!\\n\\n(5) Shyster Wasps\\nMean ones this guys are. They believe they are owners of the forest. Always atacking in groups. For them there are no rules. They thrive in torture their prays with a thousand stings.\\nMaybe they just stole the monument to see the environment crunbling for it's abstence. There are no known reasons for why would they try to unlock it's powers.\\nTip: although they are mean if there is one thing they cannot control is to fall asleep when their mother sing to them!\\n\\n\\nIn the following missions choose a number from 1 to 5\"\n",
